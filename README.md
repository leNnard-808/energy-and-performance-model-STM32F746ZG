# Energy and performance model of Neural Networks for TinyML systems

This repository serves to provide the automation scripts to ultimately create an energy and performance model.
The scripts include subjective paths, hence, prior to usage, ensure that they are tailored specifically for your application.
For further and more detailed instructions, please refer to the thesis itself.

#### Disclaimer:
The *build_custom_model* function in the *model_creation.py* script contains an additional return argument containing the model string. This is then added to the dataset so that each row in the dataset can be identified.
Furthermore, some variables may be named slightly different, as there have been many iterations to the code before writing the thesis.
